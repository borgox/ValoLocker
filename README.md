## 🔥 Features

- **Fast Instalocking**: THe instalocing process is really fast and done by using API calls and not Image manipulation;
- **Helpful Features**: When a new agent is added you can go in the *'utility'* page and reload all the agent UUIDS, so the newer agents will be added tot he list:
- **Clean GUI**: The GUI (Graphical User Interface) was made to be clean so that everything can be found quickly and won't burn your eys with a light theme 😉;
